# CS-207-Project
This is a Work in progress. The goal was to create a camera slider using a CNC shield. However I did not create the grbl code neccisary for controling the slider.
The goal for the project is to have a potentiometer control the motors to have it mpan, tilt and rotate a camera. as well as have buttons that will switch to preset movments but this will have to be worked on to reach that goal.
